              <li>
                In the past few years, the gaming industry has grown much faster than the movie and music industries. This makes it one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world. At first, video games were only for kids or small groups of people. Now, people of all ages and backgrounds like them.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are games like God of War, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and The Last of Us that have stories and emotions that are as deep as movies. But Fortnite and Valorant let people from all over the world play with each other in real time. These aren't just games; they're real life.
