    <p className="text-secondary mt-3">
      <strong>Technology-Driven Operations</strong><br />
      In the last ten years, travel and logistics have changed a lot. Capyngen is leading the way in this 
      change by offering GPS-enabled tracking, real-time updates, and AI-powered systems for managing fleets 
      and warehouses. These tools help things go faster, make things more accurate, and take the guesswork out of things.
    </p>

    <p className="text-secondary">
      <strong>Travel Experiences That Are Unique to You</strong><br />
      People who travel today want experiences that are made just for them. It doesn't matter if you're going 
      on a business trip or a vacation; personalization is important. Capyngen uses AI to look at what people 
      like and suggest flights, hotels, activities, and itineraries right away.
    </p>

    <p className="text-secondary">
      <strong>Travel and Logistics That Last</strong><br />
      Sustainability is no longer an option; it is a requirement. Capyngen helps travel and logistics companies 
      lower their carbon footprint by using renewable energy, green delivery vehicles, and optimized routes, as 
      well as by offering carbon offset programs. Our technology makes sure that performance and long-term 
      viability are always linked.
    </p>

    <p className="text-secondary">
      <strong>Backing for a Reliable Supply Chain</strong><br />
      Because e-commerce is growing, people expect quick and accurate deliveries. Smart warehouse solutions, 
      automated fulfillment, and real-time tracking of deliveries are some of the ways that Capyngen helps 
      businesses meet this need. Our systems let us keep costs low and accuracy high while still getting things 
      to you on the same day or the next day.
    </p>

    <p className="text-secondary">
      <strong>Capyngen: The Future of Travel and Getting Things Done</strong><br />
      Capyngen is fully embracing the future by using automation, drone delivery, blockchain transparency, and 
      smart contracts in its daily travel and logistics operations. These new ideas speed things up, save money, 
      and make the supply chain more reliable.
